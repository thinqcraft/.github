# Thinqcraft

Thinqcraft is a small software house focused on crafting APIs, frontends, and reliable backend systems.
We refer to ourselves as craftsmen - we value clean architecture, readable code, and long-term maintainability.


## What we do

* API development (greenfield and existing systems)
* Full-stack backend work: business logic, data flow, optimization
* Frontend development using Solid.js + Tailwind CSS - fast, lightweight, and maintainable stack
* Mobile development - we use Flutter for efficient cross-platform delivery
* Cloud infrastructure with IaC - we use Terraform, Docker and standard tooling to keep ops reproducible and under control
* Monitoring, logging, performance tuning
* Technical consulting, architecture design, and audits


## What you can expect

* Solutions that are well-structured and easy to evolve - no hidden complexity, no vendor lock-in
* Technologies selected for reliability and long-term value, not hype
* Clear architecture and consistent performance, even under load
* Codebases that are easy to understand, hand over, and scale with your business
* Direct, honest communication - no middlemen, no delays, just clear progress
